```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

First load packages:

```{r load packages, echo = T}
library(fluxweb)
library(knitr)
```

Now set the column names and rownames of the example matrix and view it:


Figure 1. Food web interaction matrix between resource *i* (rows) and consumers *j* (columns).

```{r set names and view, echo = T, fig.align='center'}
colnames(simple.case$mat) <- rownames(simple.case$mat) <- simple.case$names
knitr::kable(simple.case$mat)
```

This looks weird, as it suggest Macroalgae are eating Gammarus and Bittium and the predatory grass shrimp, Palaemonetes, is eating nothing. 

I think this is simply that the matrix is transposed:

```{r transpose, echo = T}
knitr::kable(t(simple.case$mat))
```
